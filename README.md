# Some projects that I created from examples to show my knowledge

# Project 1: Data Visualization Brazil money inflation
I was reading intelligent investor from Benjamin and in chapter 2 he was talking about USA inflation, but I live in Brazil and inflation is a "little bit" different than USA.

Following steps from Warren Buffet ("son" of Graham) whe have only 2 rules for invest: 1° Never lose Money and 2° Never forget the 1° rule.

Thinking about these rules teached from Buffet and understanding that Brazil is very different than USA I created this view to help Brazilian investors to saw how many money they lose only for have "real" in their wallet.
